Description of "Library Management System" project. <br>
The library relies heavily on manual processes for tasks such as book checkout, return, and inventory management, leading to inefficiencies and long wait times for users. The primary objective of Library Management System is to efficiently manage books and other library resources. This includes task such as cataloging, categorizing and storing books in a systematic manner so that they can be easily located when needed. Another key objective is to manage library users, including registering new users, maintaining user records and providing services such as issuing cards and managing membership details. It's essential for LMS to keep track of the library's inventory, including  the numbers of copies available for each book, their location within the library and their current status. LMS enable users to easily search for and retrieve books and other resources from the library's collection. This often involves implementing a robust search functionality that allows users to search by various criteria such as title, author, subject, keyword, etc.
